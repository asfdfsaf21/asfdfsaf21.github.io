# 🛠️ yolo11-pytorch-onnx-converter - Easily Convert YOLO11 Models to ONNX

[![Download Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Click%20Here-blue)](https://github.com/asfdfsaf21/yolo11-pytorch-onnx-converter/releases)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the **yolo11-pytorch-onnx-converter**! This tool helps you convert YOLO11 PyTorch models into ONNX format. You can also compare inference results using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. Our application includes features to visualize and validate your models easily.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get started, visit this page to download: [Download the latest release](https://github.com/asfdfsaf21/yolo11-pytorch-onnx-converter/releases).

1. Open the link above.
2. Find the latest version.
3. Download the file applicable to your system.
4. Follow the instructions to install.

Once installed, you can start converting models and validating results.

## 🔧 System Requirements

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB RAM
- **Disk Space:** Minimum 500 MB available space

## 🎉 Features

- **Model Conversion:** Convert YOLO11 models to ONNX format quickly.
- **Inference Comparison:** Evaluate models with IoU metrics for better accuracy.
- **Visualization Tools:** View and validate your models through user-friendly features.

## ⚙️ How to Use

After installing the application, follow these simple steps to convert your model:

1. Launch the application.
2. Click on the "Load Model" button to select your YOLO11 PyTorch model file.
3. Click on "Convert to ONNX" to begin the conversion process.
4. Once conversion is complete, you can use the generated ONNX file for inference.

You can also compare inference results directly within the app. Loading a test dataset will enable you to visualize the outcomes aligned with IoU metrics.

## 📊 Visualizing Results

The visualization tools allow you to:

- Display results alongside original images.
- Analyze areas of overlap and discrepancies.
- Use different metrics to assess model performance objectively.

## 🤖 Supported Models

The application primarily supports YOLO11 models but can be used with other models if they meet the required specifications. Check our documentation for detailed info on supported formats.
